<h2>Generating Parser Using Racc</h2>
<p>
To compile Racc grammar file, simply type:
</p>
<pre>
$ racc parse.y
</pre>
<p>
This creates ruby script file "parse.tab.y". -o option changes this.
</p>

<h2>Writing Racc Grammar File</h2>
<p>
If you want your own parser, you have to write grammar file.
A grammar file contains name of parser class, grammar the parser can parse,
user code, and any.<br>
When writing grammar file, yacc's knowledge is helpful.
If you have not use yacc, also racc is too difficult.
</p>
<p>
Here's example of Racc grammar file.
</p>
<pre>
class Calcparser
rule
  target: exp { print val[0] }

  exp: exp '+' exp
     | exp '*' exp
     | '(' exp ')'
     | NUMBER
end
</pre>
<p>
Racc grammar file is resembles to yacc file.
But (of cource), action is Ruby code. yacc's $$ is 'result', $0, $1... is
an array 'val', $-1, $-2... is an array '_values'.
</p>
<p>
Then you must prepare parse entry method. There's two types of
racc's parse method, 
<a href="parser.html#Racc%3a%3aParser-do_parse"><code>do_parse</code></a> and
<a href="parser.html#Racc%3a%3aParser-yyparse"><code>yyparse</code></a>.
</p>
<p>
"do_parse()" is simple. it is yyparse() of yacc, and "next_token()" is
yylex(). This method must returns an array like [TOKENSYMBOL, ITS_VALUE].
EOF is [false, false].
(token symbol is ruby symbol (got by String#intern) as default.
 If you want to change this, see <a href="grammar.html#token">grammar reference</a>.
</p>
<p>
"yyparse()" is little complecated, but useful. It does not use "next_token()",
it gets tokens from any iterator. For example, "yyparse(obj, :scan)" causes
calling obj#scan, and you can return tokens by yielding them from obj#scan.
</p>
<p>
When debugging, "-v" or/and "-g" option is helpful.
"-v" causes creating verbose log file (.output).
"-g" causes creating "Verbose Parser".
Verbose Parser prints internal status when parsing.
But it is <em>not</em> automatic.
You must use -g option and set @yydebug true to get output.
-g option only creates verbose parser.
</p>

<h3>re-distributing Racc runtime</h3>
<p>
A parser, which is created by Racc, requires Racc runtime module;
racc/parser.rb.
</p>
<p>
Ruby 1.8.x comes with racc runtime module,
you need NOT distribute racc runtime files.
</p>
<p>
If you want to run your parsers on ruby 1.6,
you need re-distribute racc runtime module with your parser.
It can be done by using '-E' option:
<pre>
$ racc -E -omyparser.rb myparser.y
</pre>
<p>
This command creates myparser.rb which `includes' racc runtime.
Only you must do is to distribute your parser file (myparser.rb).
</p>
<p>
Note: parser.rb is LGPL, but your parser is not.
Your own parser is completely yours.
