== DESCRIPTION:

  Racc is a LALR(1) parser generator.
  It is written in Ruby itself, and generates Ruby program.

  NOTE: Ruby 1.8.x comes with Racc runtime module.  You
  can run your parsers generated by racc 1.4.x out of the
  box.


== Requirement

  *  Ruby 1.8.x or later.
 (*) make and C compiler.


== Installation

  gem install:

    $ gem install racc

  setup.rb install:

  Type this in the top directory of the extracted archive:

    $ ruby setup.rb config
    $ ruby setup.rb setup
   ($ su)
    # ruby setup.rb install

  You can install Racc into your favorite directory by giving
  options to setup.rb. e.g.
  
    $ ruby setup.rb config --prefix=/usr
  
  For details, try "ruby setup.rb --help".


  If you don't have C Compiler
  ----------------------------

  You can install Racc without C compilers. Type following
  command in config phase.

    $ ruby setup.rb config --without-ext


== Testing Racc

  Racc comes with simple calculator. To compile this, on shell:

      $ racc -o calc calc.y

  This process costs few seconds (or less). Then type:

      $ ruby calc

  ... Does it works?
